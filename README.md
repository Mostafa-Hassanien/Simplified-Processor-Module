# Simplified-Processor-Module
The aim of this project is to implement a simplified processor using gate level implementation approach on NI Multisim tool. The processor contains a Control Unit (CU) for the decoding and executing, Register File containing four 8-bit registers, Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) with a simplified operation set, and a single 8-bit output port.
Keywords: CU, ALU, Register File, NI Multisim tool.
